# Approximate-Pi-Number-
To Approximate Pi Number, if we use others languages such as C++, python,... it maybe too easy with few lines of code. But in MIPS, it can take more time 
To use this code, u can use MAR MIPS to silmulate 
Output will be showed in PI.TXT file, so you have to create this one 
macro.mac file is a implement code place, include many function using system call
